# react-boiler-plate
To start the application with webpack, type "npm start" in the Terminal.

This is a basic boiler plate so feel free to make suggestions.

If you want live reload on your phone, or another machine, Use http://(host machines's ip address):3000
example: http://10.0.0.255:3000

Also, if you want to host a tunnel server, you can use ngrok and point it to port 3000 and it will give you a custom URL to host your app on.
